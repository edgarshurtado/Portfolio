## The Project

The idea for a portfolio is well known. I wanted a site of my own on the big world wide web to showcase the projects I've done (and those that are to come)

First: To experiment and learn about several technologies (Pure ES6, Flex and some grunt tasks)

Second: Publish it as landing page for my [own site](http://edgarsh.es)

I wanted to experiment and learn about several technologies with this side
project. Thus, from the beginning I forbide myself to use any framework. The
use of jQuery/Bootstrap/Vue.js/Angularjs... was not allow for the development.
Why that? Because I wanted the challenge of writting a whole page with Vanilla
javascript. Moreover, the page is so simple that I thought it was really
unnecessary to make my visitors download any extra KB.

## Project organization

On my current company, I've been using agile development methodologies. We do the whole Scrum thing. Planning, development based on user's stories and
3 week long sprints. I loved this methodology from day one for the good organization on the current projects I've been experiencing. This made me decide
to adopt some of the Scrum principles for this side-project. Of course is a very simplistic version, so simplistic that maybe I shouldn't even call
it Scrum üòÖ.

For it I've used a Trello board with 5 lists:

* To Do
* In Progress
* On Hold
* Done
* Discarded

### To Do List

This is a *prioritized* list with all the [User's Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) wanted on my portfolio. The word 
*prioritized* is stressed for a reason. I've discovered on my daily work that using a prioritized list has a huge impact on your productivity.
I've discovered to main reasons for this:

First, it allows you to not having to worry about what to pick up next when you're done with your current task. Just take the following one at the top of the list

Second. Avoids to get distracted with some cool new feature you've just came up with. It just goes at the bottom of the *To do list*, and it will be adressed eventually.

### In Progress

This is one of those lists that is much more usefull when working with a team. With it I can see which User's Stories are already being developed right now, getting those stories out of the *To do list*. As I've been a single developer while programming my portfolio, there wans't going to be any story that 
I didn't pulled myself out from the *To do list*. 

This list was never going to be bigger than one item. However I kept the list for familiarity, and because it feels great to move a story to *In progress*. Besides, it quickly tells you what you've been into the last session and fosters the hyper-focus single-task mindset. This last feature was something I discovered while using the list, rather than a reason for making the list itself. But was a pleasant discovery anyhow üòÅ.

### On Hold

I think any user's story hit this list during the whole development. The list is intended for those user's story that have been started but that for some reason you can't move them to the *Done list*. In my experience, the main reasons for keeping a User's story *On Hold* are

* You're blocked for some other User's Story that has to be finished before.
* There's something you unclear about the User's Story and you have to ask and wait until the client clarifies it

However, as there wasn't anyone else but me doing this, I've never done two User's Stories at once (Very unlikely even if I wanted ü§î). So, having prioritized properly the *To Do list* there's no reason why a User's Story should block you. And since it was a personal project, whatever the doubt about a User's story was, I answered myself üòÇ.

### Done

The last resort for any of your User's Story. The purpose of this list is cristal clear, isn't it? Any User's Story you finish the development while jump from *In Progress* to *Done*.

There's only one recomendation I'd give to you. I like to have at the top of the list the most recent User's Story. This way I can quickly see the last completed tasks, giving me more context of how the project is going than just with the *In Progress* list.

### Discarded

It happened to me a couple of times that, after starting a User's Story, I see no use on it. The feature was going to be useless, or just not worth the time. On these cases, instead of archiving, I put them into this list. There's no much use on this list either, however I like to see the things I've discarded rather than hidding them. Personal preference, I suppose.

## Making and tracking progress

Currently I'm hired as a full-time web developer, which is great for so many reason üòä but not that great in terms of letting you spare time for side projects and personal development üòì. Despite of this fact, I managed to consistently devote 1 hour to this project every day after work. And this is how I gathered about 41 hours in 2 months to build this portfolio.

I've been able to give you the exact amount of time because I've tracked every minute focused on building the project using *Toggl*. This has worked great for me, far better than I expected.

First, tracking has been a motivational burst as I could see every week that I was moving really moving forward. Then, the fact of clicking the timmer start button helps on reaching to the hyper-focused state of mind. And last but not least, mixing a tracking system with pomodoro timers (something that Toggle does out of the box) has proved to have a good impact on me, in these years (I procrastinate less, having a full session is less tough, and also helps to be focused on a 25 minutes long time lapse).
