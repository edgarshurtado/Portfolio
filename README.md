# Edgar S. Hurtado Portfolio

This is a side-project with a double objective in mind.

First: To experiment and learn about several technologies (Pure ES6, Flex and some grunt tasks)

Second: Publish it as landing page for my [own site](http://edgarsh.es)

To increase its "learning the fundations" side, the project had a simple but strong restriction. No frameworks allowed! No jQuery or Bootstrap (among others), I use them enough on my daily work.


## Stack used
* EcmaScript 6 (Using the cool features of ES6 and get used to it instead of keep developing in ES5)
* Sass (CSS extension languate. Because is so much powerfull than plain css)
* Babel (Compiles ES6 to ES5 allowing old browser support)
* Autoprefixer (adds vendor prefixes to css properties)
* Grunt
    - load-grunt-task (Easy way to load all grunt requires)
    - grunt-babel (task for running babel)
    - grunt-contrib-sass (Runs sass compilation)
    - grunt-postcss (Allows runing autoprefixer)
    - grunt-contrib-watch (Runs automatically tasks whenever any defined file is changed. Web browser auto-refresh)
